        - targets - a list of targets
          - ip_address - (Required) IP address of the target.

            - http_codes (Optional) list of http codes 100-599
            - http_code_intervals (Optional) list of http code intervals 1XX-5XX or ALL
            - grpc_codes (Optional) list of grpc codes by name, e.g, ["NOT_FOUND", "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED"]

      Notes:
        1. Exactly one listener type: http or tls or stream should be specified.
        2. sni_handler is a list of SNI handlers.
        3. if create_certificate = true, certificate should be passed as a name of newly created certificates or as a list of previously created CM certificate ids.

      How ALB load balancers is linked with HTTP router and Backend group?
        1. http_router_name variable is a link to HTTP router name.
        2. backend_group_name variable is a link to Backend group.

      ALB TLS certificate could be passed by:
        1. certificate_ids variable, it is a list of already created certificate ids
        2. cert_name variable is a name for ONLY ONE certificate from alb_certificates list!

      Example:
      ```
        alb_locations = [

    Notes:
      - Use only one type, either `managed` or `self_managed`
      - Resource creation awaits getting challenges from issue provider.
      - Self-managed certificates support only one type of `private_key` or `private_key_lockbox_secret`
      - You can provide self managed certificates and private keys as both strings and file names.
      - All self-signed certificates must be located in `<path.module>/content/tls/<your_folder>`.
      - Self-managed private keys can be read from Lockbox; for this, you need to specify the Lockbox private key secret ID and secret key.

    Parameters:
      - name
      - description
      - labels
      - domains - a list of domains for this certificate.
      - managed:
        - challenge_type - (Required) Domain owner-check method. Possible values:
          "DNS_CNAME" - you will need to create a CNAME dns record with the specified value. Recommended for fully automated certificate renewal;
          "DNS_TXT" - you will need to create a TXT dns record with specified value;
          "HTTP" - you will need to place specified value into specified url.
        - challenge_count - (Optional). Expected number of challenge count needed to validate certificate.
      - self_managed:
        - certificate_string         - (Required) Certificate as a string with chain.
        - private_key_string         - (Optional) Private key as a string of certificate.
        - certificate_filename       - (Required) Certificate filename with chain.
        - private_key_filename       - (Optional) Private key filename of certificate.
        - private_key_lockbox_secret - (Optional) Lockbox secret specification for getting private key.
          - private_key_lockbox_secret_id
